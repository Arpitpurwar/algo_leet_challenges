/**
 * 
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * 
 * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 * Example : 
 * Input: 5 
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 
 Example :
 Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
